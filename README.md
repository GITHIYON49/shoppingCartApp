This project is built using React, Tailwind CSS, React Router DOM, and Lucide Icons.

Tailwind CSS is used for styling the components and designing the user interface.

React Router DOM is used to navigate between the Home and Cart pages.

Lucide Icons are used to make the UI more attractive and user-friendly.

The useContext hook is used to share data across components and avoid unnecessary re-renders in the project.

On the Cart page, users can remove items and increase the item quantity.

If the subtotal is more than 500, a 10% discount is applied.
